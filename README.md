# Test task with MVVM, DataBinding With LiveData

Following technologies have been used:
1. Architecture Components (Lifecycle, LiveData, ViewModel)
2. DataBinding
3. Dagger2 for dependency injection
3. Tinder Scarlet library for WebSockets

Due to time considerations following features have been left TODO:
1. To make Scarlet lifecycle aware
2. Transaction data pagination
3. If application utilized more REST API endpoints token expiration check should be done on each api call
